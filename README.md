# Voting Application

A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers.

## Getting started


Run in this directory to build and run the app:

```shell
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

For the first time, execute commands described in mongo.sh one by one in terminal.

The `vote` app will be running at [http://localhost:5100](http://localhost:5100), and the `results` will be at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).
